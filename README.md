# Pre-mainnet test
This repository contains the Genesis Validator data that will be used to create the validator set for the pre-mainnet test.

# Step-by-step guide
The steps below outline how selected Genesis Validators should submit the required data for a successful launch of the pre-mainnet test:

1. Fork this repo and branch off the *master* branch. Name your own branch in the following format *[UUID]-genesis-validator-data*
2. On your branch, navigate to the `genesis-validator-data` folder.
3. Inspect the `template.json` file that shows the format in which you should submit your own json file.
4. Create a new json file called `[UUID].json`, containing your validator info as per the `template.json` file.
5. Open a pull request against the *master* branch and name the PR *"[UUID]-genesis-validator-data"*
6. The team will review your PR, verify your ownership proof and merge it if all checks pass. You have now successfully submitted your genesis validator data for the pre-mainnet test!
